    <h1>Coding Challenge IV</h1>
    <p>
        Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared their BMIs.<br/>Let's now implement the same functionality with objects and methods.
        <ol>
            <li>
                For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter). <br/>
        GOOD LUCK! ðŸ˜€
