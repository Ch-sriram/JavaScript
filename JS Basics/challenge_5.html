    <h1>Coding Challenge V</h1>
    <p>
        Remember the tip calculator challenge? Let's create a more advanced version using everything we learned!<br/>
        This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.<br/>
        John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.<br/>
        Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:
        <ol>
            <li>Create an object with an array for the bill values.</li>
            <li>Add a method to calculate the tip.</li>
            <li>
                This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations.
            </li>
            <li>
                As an output, create:
                <ol>
                    <li>A new array containing all tips, and</li>
                    <li>An array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip).</li>
                </ol> 
                HINT: Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.
                EXTRA AFTER FINISHING: Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4 different restaurants. The bills were $77, $375, $110, and $45.
                Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when the bill is between $100 and $300, and 25% if the bill is more than $300 (different than John).
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping rules.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a given array of tips. 
                HINT: Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a variable (starting from 0). After you have the sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you calculate the average).
            </li>
            <li>Calculate the average tip for each family.</li>
            <li>Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average.</li>
        </ol>
        GOOD LUCK! ðŸ˜€
