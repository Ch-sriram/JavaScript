    <h1>Coding Challenge II</h1>
    <p>
        John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.
        <ol>
            <li>Calculate the average score for each team</li>
            <li>
                Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
            </li>
            <li>
                Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").
            </li>
            <li>
                Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score).
            </li>
            <li>
                EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem :)
            </li>
            <li>
                Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.
            </li>
        </ol>
        GOOD LUCK! ðŸ˜€
