        <p class="lead text-left">
            In order to make our lives a bit easier when writing JavaScript code, we are going to add the 
            <strong>Webpack Dev Server</strong> to our setup. Because of adding Webpack Dev Server, we will have 
            automatic page reload when we save our code. Therefore, besides all the amazing functionalities included
            in Webpack, it also provides us with a <strong>Development Server</strong> which will automatically
            bundle all our JavaScript files and then reload the app in the browser whenever we change a file. This
            will save a lot of time when writing our JavaScript app. And so, we install the Webpack Dev Server using
            NPM (as it is an NPM Package) as shown below (command is: <code>npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev</code>).
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-1.png" alt="wds-1" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />
        
        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now we check the <code>package.json</code> file to see whether <strong>Webpack Dev Server</strong> is 
            mentioned inside <code>"devDependencies"</code> object. <code>package.json</code> is shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-2.png" alt="wds-2" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now, in order to configure our dev server, we will add another field to <code>webpack.config.js</code> 
            file (which is our configuration file). The field that we add in the <code>module.exports</code> object 
            is <code>devServer</code>. The <code>devServer</code> field is an object, in which we first add the field
            <code>contentBase</code> where we specify the folder from where Webpack can serve the files. In this
            case, that's the <code>dist</code> folder in our app. Therefore, we set <code>contentBase</code> as, 
            <code>contentBase: './dist'</code>. We put <code>./dist</code> as our <code>contentBase</code> because
            all of our code inside the <code>./dist</code> folder is the code that will be shipped to the client and
            therefore, all of the final production code is inside the <code>./dist</code> folder. <code>./src</code>
            folder is only there for development purposes, not for distribution/deployment purposes. Therefore, all
            our source code for the app goes in <code>./src</code> folder, which then gets compiled and bundled into
            the <code>./dist</code> folder as <code>bundle.js</code>, and so, what we really want to serve to the
            client/end-user is the resource (code, html) inside the <code>./dist</code> folder.
            After we make the changes, the configuration file, i.e., <code>webpack.config.js</code> file should look 
            as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-3.png" alt="wds-3" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            To make the Webpack Dev Server work, we add an <strong>npm script</strong> to <code>package.json</code>.
            Inside <code>package.json</code>, in the <code>"scripts"</code> field, we add a new field which is the 
            standard name for dev servers and it is called <code>"start"</code>. Therefore, the script 
            <code>"start"</code> is a script that will always keep running in the background and updates the browser
            as soon as we change our code. When we run the <code>"start"</code> script, what we want <code>npm</code>
            to do is to run the webpack dev server in development mode and then open the app in the browser 
            automatically. 
            So for that, we give our script as: "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --open" as shown 
            below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-4.png" alt="wds-4" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We will run the <strong>npm script</strong> with the command - <code>npm run start</code> as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-5.png" alt="wds-5" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            And the <strong>npm script</strong> opens the browser with <code>./dist/index.html</code> and we get the
            output in the console as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-6.png" alt="wds-6" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            The only difference when opening <code>./dist/index.html</code> normally, opening it like this is, now 
            <code>./dist/index.html</code> is running on a local webserver (as we can see the address above which 
            says: <code>localhost:8080</code>) where it is simulating a real HTTP server while when we open it
            normally, it is just opening as a file (using the <code>file://...</code> protocol). <br><br>

            Now, we can see changes in the app as and when we change the code in the app. We will be able to see the
            output being reflected instantly in webpack dev server (which is <code>localhost:8080</code> in our
            browser). So now, if we change the code in the <code>./src/js/test.js</code> and 
            <code>./src/js/index.js</code> files, we will see those changes being reflected 
            @<code>localhost:8080</code>. The changes we made in the files is shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-7.png" alt="wds-7" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />
        
        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now, the output we should see in the console should be: <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<code>Imported Module</code> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<code>We just imported 12345 from another module called test</code> <br>
            But the output we get is shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-8.png" alt="wds-8" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            The output we get is the same as the previous output and that's because, when we run the development 
            server, webpack will bundle our modules together but it will actually not write it to a file on disk, 
            instead webpack will automatically inject it into the html file (in our case, it is 
            <code>./dist/index.html</code>). Therefore, we can go ahead and delete the 
            <code>./dist/js/bundle.js</code> file, because whenever we run ><code>npm run start</code>, it is still
            reading JavaScript from <code>./dist/js/bundle.js</code> file, which we do not want and not from the one
            we are generating on the fly through the webpack dev server and that's also because there's a little 
            problem in the webpack configuration file also. In our <code>webpack.config.js</code> file, in the 
            <code>module.exports</code> object, the concerned field, which <code>ouput</code> field, has a property
            called <code>path</code>, which resolved as the current absolute path along with <code>'dist/js'</code>.
            And because of <code>'dist/js'</code>, every time we run ><code>npm run start</code>, the webpack dev 
            server will try to inject the dynamically made <code>bundle.js</code> file into an html file which it is
            trying to find inside the <code>.../dist/js</code> folder. But the required html file (which is 
            <code>.../dist/index.html</code>) is present in the parent folder, which is <code>dist</code>. 
            Therefore, we change and resolve the path to current absolute path along with it, we concatenate 
            <code>'dist'</code>. Then, for <code>/dist/index.html</code> to find the Bundled JavaScript file, we 
            change the <code>filename</code> property from <code>'bundle.js'</code> to <code>'js/bundle.js'</code>. 
            After those changes, all we have managed to do is, we have changed the output folder to the entire 
            <code>dist</code> folder. The changes made in <code>webpack.config.js</code> file is shown below. 
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-9.png" alt="wds-9" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now we again run the <strong>npm script</strong> -- <code>start</code> using the command:
            ><code>npm run start</code>, and we see the output in the browser @<code>localhost:8080</code> as shown
            below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-10.png" alt="wds-10" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now we change the code inside <code>./src/js/test.js</code> or <code>./src/js/index.js</code>, we will 
            see the changes being reflected instantly in the browser @<code>localhost:8080</code> as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-11.png" alt="wds-11" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-12.png" alt="wds-12" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Note that we didn't re-run the ><code>npm run start</code> command or anything, everything happened 
            dynamically. Now, we can actually delete the distribution code, which is <code>bundle.js</code> located
            at <code>./dist/js</code> and still the code will execute in the server because <strong>we are running in development mode</strong> and therefore, the <code>bundle.js</code> generated is directly being 
            injected into <code>./dist/index.html</code> file rather than being written on the disk. <br>
            We can see below that there's no <code>bundle.js</code> file inside <code>./dist/js</code> folder.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-13.png" alt="wds-13" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            And now we again make changes to <code>./src/js/test.js</code> file and we can see the changes being
            registered in the browser @<code>localhost:8080</code> as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-14.png" alt="wds-14" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-15.png" alt="wds-15" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            And so, the <code>bundle.js</code> file from <code>./dist/js</code> is actually gone, but our webpack
            dev server running @<code>localhost:8080</code> in the browser, is still actually registering the changes
            we make inside the app. That's great! <br><br>

            One final thing we would do (apart from making the webpack dev server work for us) is to copy the 
            <code>index.html</code> file from <code>./src</code> folder, into our distribution folder, i.e.,
            <code>./dist</code>. Now, in <code>index.html</code> from <code>./src</code>, we can go ahead and delete
            the <code>&lt;script src="bundle.js">&lt;/script></code> tag, or just comment it. Now, what we want to 
            do is that, we want to copy the markup of <code>./src/index.html</code> into 
            <code>./dist/index.html</code> and inject the <code>&lt;script src="bundle.js">&lt;script></code> tag 
            into it automatically. This can be done using webpack very easily. Now, in order to do that, we use 
            something called <strong>plugins</strong>. <br><br>

            Remember the <strong>four core concepts</strong> of webpack? <strong>entry points</strong>, 
            <strong>output</strong>, <strong>loaders</strong> and <strong>plugins</strong>. We will now talk about
            <strong>plugins</strong>. <strong>Plugins</strong> allow us to do complex processing of our input files,
            and in this case our input file is <code>./src/index.html</code>. Therefore we will use a plugin called
            <strong>html webpack plugin</strong> and in order to use it, we have to install it using 
            <code>npm</code>. Command to install it: <code>npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev</code>. It is 
            also shown below (along with changes that have been automatically made in <code>package.json</code>).
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-16.png" alt="wds-16" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-17.png" alt="wds-17" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now we have to make changes in the webpack configuration, i.e., in <code>webpack.config.js</code> file.
            We have to <code>require()</code> the file, i.e., <code>import</code> the file and save it into a 
            variable inside the <code>webpack.config.json</code> file. The convention for the name of the variable
            used for importing the file(s) for <code>html-webpack-plugin</code> is <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code>.
            <br><br>
            Now, inside the <code>module.exports</code> object, we can specify a new property called 
            <code>plugins</code>, which receives an array of all the plugins that we are using. And the first plugin
            (and the only one in our case) is the <code>html-webpack-plugin</code>. Therefore, we make an instance
            of HtmlWebpackPlugin and to its constructor, we send in an object (In Modern JS, we generally pass 
            options/parameters to the constructor as an object) containing two properties which are 
            <code>filename</code> and <code>template</code> where, <code>filename</code> is the target file onto
            which we want to copy the content of file mentioned in the <code>template</code> field. <em>Note that we 
            only mention the name of the target file i.e., <code>'index.html'</code> in the <code>filename</code> 
            field, because the path is taken care by webpack by looking at the <code>path</code> field mentioned 
            inside the <code>output</code> object of <code>module.exports</code> object of the 
            <code>webpack.config.js</code> file. And also, the <code>template</code> field needs to have the source
            file mentioned along with the relative path i.e., <code>'./src/index.html'</code></em>. <br>
            The modified webpack configuration file is shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-18.png" alt="wds-18" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We will start the webpack dev server again now using the <code>npm</code> command: 
            <code>npm run start</code> as shown below, and it will open <code>./dist/index.html</code> (if 
            <code>index.html</code> is not available at <code>./dist</code>, webpack will automatically create
            <code>index.html</code> inside <code>./dict</code>. As a matter of fact, we can delete 
            <code>index.html</code> from <code>./dist</code> and check whether webpack automatically creates
            <code>index.html</code> for us inside <code>./dist</code> folder) in the browser 
            @<code>localhost:8080</code>, with the code copied from <code>./src/index.html</code> as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-19.png" alt="wds-19" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-20.png" alt="wds-20" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            And when we check the console, it is still logged output from <code>./src/js/index.js</code> as shown 
            below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-21.png" alt="wds-21" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We can delete the existing <code>./dist/index.html</code> file and the server wouldn't crash, because
            we are running the app in the webserver in <strong>development mode</strong>. We can see below that
            <code>./dist/index.html</code> is deleted, but the webserver @<code>localhost:8080</code> didn't crash,
            as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-22.png" alt="wds-22" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-20.png" alt="wds-20" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            And also, we can see from the image above that <code>bundle.js</code> is still not created inside 
            <code>./dist/js</code> folder. The app is still running well because the app is running still in 
            <strong>development mode</strong>. To actually write the <code>index.html</code> and 
            <code>bundle.js</code> into the <code>./dist</code> and <code>./dist/js</code> folders respectively, we
            simply run either of the <strong>npm script</strong> we created earlier which were <code>build</code> and
            <code>dev</code> by simply running the command: <code>npm run build</code> or <code>npm run dev</code>,
            where <code>build</code> script generates the minified and optimized <code>bundle.js</code> whereas 
            <code>dev</code> script generates un-optimized <code>bundle.js</code>, inside <code>./dist/js</code> 
            folder. Both scripts generate <code>index.html</code> inside the <code>./dist</code> folder.
            The generated files along with the working of the command (dev version) is shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-23.png" alt="wds-23" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-24.png" alt="wds-24" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We can also see that inside <code>./dist/index.html</code>,
            <code>&lt;script src="js/bundle.js">&lt;/script></code> is automatically copied from the webpack 
            configuration file where we gave the <code>filename</code> to be <code>'js/bundle.js'</code> as shown
            below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/wds-25.png" alt="wds-25" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            The only thing that's missing now is <strong>Babel</strong> which converts ESNext JavaScript Code to 
            ES5 JavaScript Code for compatibility across all the web browsers out there.
