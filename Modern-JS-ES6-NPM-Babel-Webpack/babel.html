            When we open <a href="https://www.babeljs.io">Babel JS' Official Homepage</a>, it says:
            <strong>Babel is a JavaScript Compiler</strong>.

            We can always dive into the <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/">Documentation of Babel</a> to setup
            Babel. In order for our project to include Babel, we need to download a couple of packages. 
            The packages that we need to install for Babel to work are: <code>@babel/core</code>, 
            <code>@babel/preset-env</code> (which will convert all the modern JS code back to ES5 code),
            <code>babel-loader</code> (needed by Webpack in order to load Babel files). We install them using the 
            <code>npm</code> command line where we save them as devDependencies in our project as shown below. <br> 
            (Command: <code>npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader --save-dev</code>. Note that we can install multiple packages using a single <code>npm install ...</code> command)
        </p>

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We can check our <code>package.json</code> file to check what's new inside <code>"devDependencies"</code>
            field.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/babel-3.png" alt="babel-3" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Coming back to Webpack, we know that <strong>Webpack has four core concepts</strong> which are 
            <strong>entry points</strong>, <strong>output</strong>, <strong>plugins</strong> & 
            <strong>loaders</strong>. <strong>Loaders</strong> in Webpack allow us to import/load all kinds of 
            different files, and more importantly, to also process them. Like converting Sass to CSS code, or 
            converting ES6 to ES5 code, (which is exactly what we want from setting up Babel) and for that we need
            the Babel Loader because Babel is the tool that converts ES6+ code to ES5 for backward compatibility
            reasons. The syntax to include Babel into our project along with Webpack is a bit weird. <br><br>

            What we do is, in the Webpack Configuration file (which is <code>webpack.config.js</code>), inside the
            <code>module.exports</code> object, we define a new property named <code>module</code>, which is an
            object, in which we specify the <code>rules</code> property. <code>rules</code> property receives an 
            array of all of the loaders that we want to use in our project. For each of the loader that the 
            <code>rules</code> property takes in its array, it is to be passed as an object. Inside the respective
            loader object, we need a property called <code>test</code> which takes in a 
            <strong>regular expression</strong> (aka <strong>regex</strong>). In our particular case, for the regex 
            we will test all the files that end with '.js', because we want to convert all our code written in 
            the JavaScript files (which is ES6+) to be converted into ES5 code, and to do that, Babel actually needs
            to find the JavaScript files that it can convert. And so, we give the regex <code>/\.js$/</code> in our
            <code>test</code> property. Now, we do want to convert all JavaScript files back to ES5, but we only want
            to do that with our project's code, not the from the <code>./node_modules</code> directory. Therefore,
            we should exclude all the JavaScript files that are inside the <code>./node_modules</code> directory.
            Therefore, we also have a property for that in our loader object which is known as <code>exclude</code>.
            The <code>exclude</code> property again takes in a regex, where the loader (in our case babel-loader)
            will see the directories/files that are to be excluded from being loaded onto babel-core for conversion.
            For that, we give the <code>/node_modules/</code> regex to the <code>exclude</code> property. Now,
            finally, we have to mention which loader should these rules be applied to? And so, for that we define one
            more property called <code>use</code>, which takes in an object inside which we define another property
            called <code>loader</code>. The <code>loader</code> property is to be defined as 
            <code>'babel-loader'</code> because we want all these rules to be applied through the 
            <strong>babel-loader</strong>. All the changes made to the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file is shown
            below.
        </p>

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now we need a <strong>Babel Configuration File</strong> which is to be made inside our project named as
            <code>.babelrc</code>, and so, it will be made inside our project directory as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/babel-5.png" alt="babel-5" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            <code>.babelrc</code> file inside <code>./</code> (which is our project directory) is not a JavaScript 
            file (unlike <code>webpack.config.js</code>), but it is a dot file, in which we have an object. In the 
            object, (using JSON format), we pass the <code>"presets"</code> property and the <code>"presets"</code>
            property takes in a 2D array, inside which each 1D array contains details about the environment for which
            Babel needs to generate the code for. Now, <strong>presets</strong> in general are a collection of code 
            transform plugins, which are like pieces of code that actually apply the actual transformation or 
            conversion to our code, from ES6+ to ES6. And the <strong>preset</strong> that we select here is the 
            <code>"@babel/env"</code> preset, (which stands for <strong>environment</strong>) and we actually 
            installed the <code>babel-preset-env</code> as package and it got included in our 
            <code>package.json</code> inside <code>"devDependencies"</code> field. And therefore, in the Babel 
            Config file (which is <code>.babelrc</code>) we define what are the parameters of 
            <code>babel-preset-env</code>. <br><br>

            After that we specify the environment (i.e., Browsers) that we want to target. Inside the 1D array of
            the <code>"presets"</code> field, we send in <code>"@babel/env"</code> and then we pass in an object. 
            Inside the object, we send in another field called <code>"targets"</code> which is again an object. The 
            <code>"targets"</code> object defines the <strong>browsers</strong> to which we want to cater our code 
            to. Therefore, inside the <code>"targets"</code> property, we pass in an object inside which, we pass in
            the <code>"browsers"</code> field, which is an array that takes in the browsers that we want to target
            or cater our code to (i.e., we are specifying how much backward compatibility we want). Inside the 
            <code>"browsers"</code> array field, we pass in information about all the browsers i.e., 
            <code>"last 5 version"</code> or <code>"last 10 versions"</code>, meaning, we want Babel to convert the
            ES6+ code in such a way that it is backward compatible with previous 5 or 10 versions of the all the 
            browsers. We can also specify settings for a specific browser saying: <code>"ie >= 8"</code>. We can add
            more browser restrictions and we can find more about it in Babel's Documentation. The changes made inside
            <code>.babelrc</code> file are shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/babel-6.png" alt="babel-6" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Right now, all the versions of ES6+ in our codebase will convert to ES5 JavaScript code. Now, there are 
            some things that we cannot really convert back to ES5 and those are things that are new to ES6+ code, and
            which were not present in any way, in ES5. And to convert the language features of ES6+ to ES5 where that
            feature is not present at all in ES5, we need to use something known as <strong>polyfills</strong>. 
            Because some features of ES6+ like <code>Promise</code>s or methods like <code>Array.from()</code>, or
            basically stuff that was not present in ES5, have to be <strong>polyfilled</strong> or in other words,
            we add the implementation(s) of these ES6+ features as ES5 code in our codebase, because if they were not
            a feature of ES5, then we cannot convert them back in any form, and therefore there's only one way to get
            uniform ES5 code, and that's to implement these ES6+ features in ES5 code, using polyfills. To use a 
            <strong>polyfill</strong> we need to install it via <code>npm</code> as shown below. <br>
            (Command: <code>npm install @babel/polyfill --save</code>. Note that we used <code>--save</code> here,
            which means that <strong>polyfill</strong> is not a development dependency, it is a code dependency. 
            That means that we will actually import the code from the <code>@babel/polyfill</code> package into our
            project codebase)
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/babel-7.png" alt="babel-7" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We can check <code>package.json</code> in the <code>"dependencies"</code> field that 
            <code>'@babel/polyfill'</code> in installed as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/babel-8.png" alt="babel-8" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now all we have to do is that we have to add the <code>babel-polyfill</code> to our Webpack Configuration
            File (i.e., to <code>webpack.config.json</code> file). We add <code>babel-polyfill</code> as an 
            <strong>entry point</strong>. Therefore, we change our <code>entry</code> property inside the 
            <code>module.exports</code> object of the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file into an array that takes in
            two elements, one is <code>'@babel/polyfill'</code> and the other is <code>'./src/js/index.js'</code>. 
            The changes made to the <code>webpack.config.json</code> file is shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/babel-9.png" alt="babel-9" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Webpack will automatically figure out where the code for <code>@babel/polyfill</code> is located inside
            <code>./node_modules</code> directory and include it in our project and therefore, our final project
            which is in <code>bundle.js</code> will also include code from <code>@babel/polyfill</code> package.
            <br><br>

            Now to test out the functionalities of Babel, we just edit some code inside 
            <code>./src/js/index.js</code>. Inside <code>index.js</code> we just introduce some ES6+ code and then
            later, we will generate the bundle using <code>npm run dev</code> and then check whether the ES6+ code 
            that we wrote, has been changed back to ES5 in <code>./dist/js/bundle.js</code>. 
            Therefore, we first make some changes to the code inside <code>./src/js/index.html</code> as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/babel-10.png" alt="babel-10" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            And now we run the command: <code>npm run dev</code> to generate <code>./dist/js/bundle.js</code>
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/babel-11.png" alt="babel-11" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />
        
        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now, we check the <code>bundle.js</code> inside <strong>./dist/js/</strong>, where we can check that the
            code we wrote in <code>index.js</code> from <strong>./src/js/</strong> is converted to ES5 code, because
            we used <strong>Babel</strong>. The converted code inside the <code>bundle.js</code> file is shown below.
            <br>
            (Although the code we see is all messy, we can evidently see that all the code in there, is ES5 code)
