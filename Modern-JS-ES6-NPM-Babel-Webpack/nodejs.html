        <p class="lead text-left">
            Download and Install <mark>Node.js</mark> from <a href="https://www.nodejs.org/en">here</a> (download 
            the one with "Recommended For Most Users"). After that, check if Node.js has been installed in the system
            properly by typing in the commands in terminal or the command prompt, as shown in the screenshot below.
        </p>

        <p class="lead text-left">
            The output of those two commands shown above, should be the version numbers of Node.js and NPM as shown
            above. If that's not the case, then there was some problem while installation of Node.js and therefore,
            we might've to re-install Node.js. <br><br>
            
            After that, we now create a <code>package.json</code> file for our project using the command line. Note: 
            We have to be in the respective project folder to create the <code>package.json</code> file. We simply
            type in: <code>npm init</code> command in the command prompt (or terminal) and the terminal will ask
            about the <mark>project name</mark>, <mark>description</mark>, <mark>entry point</mark>, etc as shown
            below in the screenshot. Fill them up as shown in the screenshot below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/ss-2.png" alt="ss-2" class="img-thumbnail mb-3"/>
        <p class="lead text-left">
            We can clearly see that <code>package.json</code> file has been created. We can also see the content of 
            <code>package.json</code> file. We can see that the file reflects the data that we gave as input when
            creating the <code>package.json</code> file. We will get to know more about <code>package.json</code>
            file in-detail, a little bit later. <br><br>

            We will now install <strong>Webpack</strong> using NPM. To install Webpack, we use the following command:
            <code>npm install webpack --save-dev</code> in the terminal as shown below (we might see some warning(s)
            , but that's not to fret about. If there are errors, then we need to run the command as administrator/
            superuser).
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/ss-3.png" alt="ss-3" class="img-thumbnail"/>
        <img src="./assets/images/ss-4.png" alt="ss-4" class="img-thumbnail mb-3"/>
        <p class="lead text-left">
            In the command, <code>npm install webpack --save-dev</code>, "<code>--save-dev</code>" means that we
            save Webpack as <strong>Development Dependency</strong>. We can see that in our <code>package.json</code>
            file shown below, that <code>"webpack"</code> is saved in the <code>package.json</code> file inside the
            <code>"devDependencies"</code> field with its version number.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/ss-5.png" alt="ss-5" class="img-thumbnail mb-3"/>
        <p class="lead text-left">
            There are two type of Node.js packages. The first one's are libraries & frameworks, stuff like that, and
            the others are <strong>development tools</strong>. Libraries like React or jQuery they all are really
            dependencies, because we use the code from React, jQuery, etc, in our product/app. But something like 
            Webpack is really just a development tool, and therefore, it's saved inside the <code>package.json</code>
            in the <code>"devDependencies"</code> field. Now, imagine if we wanted to use something like jQuery
            (which is an actual dependency from which we import actual code and use the code in our project), then
            we install it using the following command: <code>npm install jquery --save</code>. Note that in this 
            command, we just used <code>"--save"</code> instead of <code>"--save-dev"</code>, because jQuery is a 
            library dependency, and not a development dependency. We can see see the command in action below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/ss-6.png" alt="ss-6" class="img-thumbnail mb-3"/>
        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now we can see the contents of <code>package.json</code> below and see that <code>"jquery"</code> is
            inside the <code>"dependencies"</code> field as shown below, because jQuery is a library and not a tool.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/ss-7.png" alt="ss-7" class="img-thumbnail mb-3"/>
        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now, the <code>package.json</code> file has all the information regarding the dependencies, development
            dependencies, etc, in our project. Now that's very important, because if we want to move this project to
            another computer or work with another person on the same project, then everyone's on the same page by 
            simply looking into the <code>package.json</code> file. Everyone will get to know the dependencies being
            used in the project just by having a glance in the <code>package.json</code> file. It is also important
            to create a <code>package.json</code> file because it allows us to install all of our dependencies
            automatically even if we don't have the <strong>node_modules</strong> directory in our project. The 
            node_modules folder is where all our packages (dependencies or development dependencies) reside i.e., it
            will have all the dependencies for the dependencies that we installed in our project. For instance,
            Webpack and jQuery themselves have so many dependencies, so the node_modules folder also contains the 
            dependencies of the dependencies we installed for our project. <br><br>
            Now, if we want to share our project to someone else, <strong>we need not share the node_modules</strong>
            folder. Because all the required details are there inside the <code>package.json</code> file. So anyone
            who's having the project files (without the node_modules folder) along with the 
            <code>package.json</code> file, he/she can simply run <code>npm install</code> command, and all the 
            required devDependencies and dependencies will be installed in the project folder in the node_modules 
            folder. We will illustrate that in the screenshots below. We will delete the node_modules folder first, 
            and then just type in <code>npm install</code> in the directory where our project files are (along with
            <code>package.json</code> file), and we will see that the node_modules folder will be created in our 
            project's directory automatically, where all the dependencies requuired for the project, will reside.
        </p>

        <img src="./assets/images/ss-9.png" alt="ss-9" class="img-thumbnail mb-3"/>
        <p class="lead text-left">
            One last thing is that we can also uninstall the packages. In our project we don't really have a need for
            jQuery, so we go ahead and uninstall it as shown in the screenshot below, using the following command:
            <code>npm uninstall jquery --save</code>
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/ss-10.png" alt="ss-10" class="img-thumbnail mb-3"/>
        <p class="lead text-left">
            We can see that the <code>package.json</code> reflects that "jquery" has been uninstalled, as it is not
            present inside the "dependencies" field of the <code>package.json</code> file as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/ss-11.png" alt="ss-11" class="img-thumbnail mb-3"/>
        <p class="lead text-left">
            A final thing to know is, the packages that we installed till now (i.e., Webpack and jQuery using the 
            <code>--save-dev</code> and <code>--save</code> respectively) are locally installed. It means that they
            are installed only for this particular project. But we can also install packages globally, so that those
            packages will be accessible everywhere in our computer. Right now, the "webpack" devDependency only works
            inside the project, but if we want to install it globally and access it everywhere, we could also do that
            . <br><br>
            We will now see how we can install packages globally. We will install the <strong>Live Server</strong> 
            package globally using the following command: <code>npm install live-server --global</code> (instead of 
            <code>--global</code> we could've als used <code>-g</code>). Live Server allows us to create a simple and
            local web server to serve some static websites.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/ss-12.png" alt="ss-12" class="img-thumbnail mb-3"/>
        <img src="./assets/images/ss-13.png" alt="ss-13" class="img-thumbnail mb-3"/>
        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now we can run the command <code>live-server</code> from anywhere in the system, and in the respective
            folder, a live local webserver is created on the loopback address (127.0.0.1) on port 8080 as shown 
            below.
