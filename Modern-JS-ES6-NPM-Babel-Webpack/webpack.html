            <strong>Webpack</strong> is the most commonly used asset bundler. Webpack doesn't only bundle JS files
            into bundles, but it bundles all kinds of assets like JS files, CSS, Images, etc, into a single file 
            as shown below.
        </p>

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We will use Webpack v4.0 and above in which something known as <strong>zero configuration</strong>, where
            we don't even nee to write a configuration file. If we want to use zero configuration, we just need to 
            have a <strong>source</strong> folder (aka <code>src</code>) in the <strong>root</strong> of the project 
            and in there, a single <code>index.js</code> file. The webpack will automatically create a
            <strong>distribution</strong> folder (aka <code>dist</code>) and put the bundled file in there. But that
            is just for really small projects/apps. For bigger apps, we definitely have to write the 
            <strong>configuration</strong> file ourselves. Now, in order to do that, we have to add a configuration 
            file in our app/project root named as <code>webpack.config.js</code> as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-2.png" alt="webpack-2" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            In the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file, we have only one object in which we can specify our settings
            or configuration. We basically want to export this configuration object Node.js syntax. For that, we 
            assign the object to <code>module.exports</code>. Now, <code>module.exports</code> is simply there to 
            export the configuration object, so that webpack can take this object and do its magic.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-3.png" alt="webpack-3" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            To create a configuration, we need to know the 4 core concepts of webpack -
            The <strong>entry point</strong>, <strong>output</strong>, <strong>loaders</strong> and <strong>plugins</strong>. 
            We will do a very simple configuration here to show how we usually configure. Starting with the entry 
            point, it is a property in the <code>modules.export</code> object where, the webpack starts the bundling
            of files in our app/project. Basically, <code>entry</code> property needs to be mentioned with the file 
            where all the dependencies can be looked upon, so that webpack can bundle it together. In the
            <code>entry</code> property, we can specify one or more entry files, but for now, we will keep it simple,
            and just give one entry file which is <code>index.js</code> as shown below. Next, we need to define the 
            <code>output</code> property in the <code>modules.export</code> which will tell webpack, where to save 
            the final bundled file. <code>output</code> property, is an object where we put a path in the
            <code>path</code> property, which is an absolute path to the directory where we want our final bundled 
            file to be in. And finally, we give the name of the file (conventionally named as <code>bundle.js</code>)
            in the <code>filename</code> property. Now, to get the absolute path, we use a built-in node package, 
            which we have to include in the <code>webpack.config.js</code> as 
            <code>const path = require('path');</code>. Now, in the <code>path</code> property inside the 
            <code>output</code> object, we will use the package we imported as 
            <code>path.resolve(__dirname, &lt;param2>)</code>, where <code>__dirname</code>
            is the <strong>absolute path</strong> and &lt;param2> is the path to inside the absolute path as shown
            below. Now, we can go ahead and continue now, but to make things a little better, because in webpack v4 
            and above, we now have something called the <strong>production</strong> and the
            <strong>development</strong> mode. The development mode simply builds our bundle without minifying our
            code in order for our bundling to be as fast as possible. Whereas the production mode will automatically
            enable all kinds of optimization(s), like minifying and tree shaking in order to reduce the final bundle
            size. Our very first configuration file is as below (we will look into loaders and plugins later).
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-4.png" alt="webpack-4" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now, to test how webpack bundles our files, we need to create a a new JavaScript file, say 
            <code>test.js</code>. Now, we know that in the webpack configuration file, we have mentioned the entry
            point to be <code>index.js</code> and therefore, if we want to include a new module inside the entry
            point in order to test if the other module gets included and if they're bundled together or not. So just
            for testing purposes, let's add a new file in the <strong>src</strong> folder named <code>test.js</code>
            as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-5.png" alt="webpack-5" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            And in <code>test.js</code> we log something to the console, just for testing purposes. And then, we can
            also export something from <code>test.js</code>. To export something, we use the <code>export</code>
            keyword, followed by a <code>default</code> export or a <code>named</code> export. And so, we can write 
            the code as shown below (we will know more about <code>default</code> and <code>named</code> exports
            later). 
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-6.png" alt="webpack-6" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now, in the entry point (which is the <code>index.js</code> file), we can go ahead and import the 
            value that we exported in <code>test.js</code> by also naming it. The way we import the value, is given
            below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-7.png" alt="webpack-7" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now, the pieces of code that we wrote in <code>test.js</code> and <code>index.js</code> where we
            exported and imported values respectively, won't run in the browser if we do not use webpack or some 
            kind of a bundler and that is exactly why we are using webpack. <br><br>

            We now have to update our <code>package.json</code> and add an <strong>npm script</strong>. We use npm
            scripts because that's the only well known and efficient way to launch our locally installed dev 
            dependencies. We can see the <code>package.json</code> file below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-8.png" alt="webpack-8" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now, in order for us to bundle everything in our project into <code>bundle.js</code>, we need to install
            one more thing, which is <strong>Webpack Command Line Interface</strong>. We install Webpack CLI using 
            NPM (as our development dependencies) in the terminal using the command shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-9.png" alt="webpack-9" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We can look into our <code>package.json</code> file for the reflected changes, specifically, we need to 
            look into <code>"devDependencies"</code> field where we can see that <code>"webpack-cli"</code> is added
            along with its version, as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-10.png" alt="webpack-10" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now, to bundle the modules together, we simply go to the terminal and type in
            <code>npm run &lt;script_name></code> where our &lt;script_name> in this case is "dev", as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-11.png" alt="webpack-11" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We can see that <code>bundle.js</code> has been created inside the <code>dist/js/</code> as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-12.png" alt="webpack-12" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Finally, we make a dummy html file, say <code>index.html</code> inside <code>/dist/</code> as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-13.png" alt="webpack-13" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            And then import <code>bundle.js</code> in <code>index.js</code> as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-14.png" alt="webpack-14" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We open <code>/dist/index.html</code> and then check the developer console for the output, and we should
            see the output shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-15.png" alt="webpack-15" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            Now, we bundled our code on the basis that the <code>mode</code> in the <code>webpack.config.js</code>
            file was <code>"development"</code>. If we change the <code>mode</code> to <code>"production"</code>, 
            the bundled file generated from webpack will be extremely small, as it will be minified and completely
            optimized. But, if we want to produce production level bundled file a lot of times, we can just 
            manually go into the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file and change the <code>mode</code> field every 
            time. But that would be counter-productive. So, we generally would write <strong>npm scripts</strong> for
            such things. Inside the <code>package.json</code> file, we will write an npm script inside the 
            <code>"scripts"</code> object, where we write a script to be run for <code>"dev"</code> and we write
            another script for <code>"build"</code> as shown below (Note that <code>"build"</code> script should be
            run when we want to bundle the project for production).
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-16.png" alt="webpack-16" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            And we will test whether the scripts are working properly or not, by typing in the commands shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-17.png" alt="webpack-17" class="img-thumbnail" />
        <img src="./assets/images/webpack-11.png" alt="webpack-11" class="img-thumbnail mb-3" />

        <p class="lead text-left">
            We can clearly see that the <code>build.js</code> generated after running the command: 
            <code>npm run dev</code> had a size of 4.64 KB, whereas <code>bundle.js</code> generated from the
            command: <code>npm run build</code> had a size of 1.01 KB, which is very less compared to 4.64 KB, as 
            the it is a minified and optimized bundle. <br><br>

            Now running these <strong>npm scripts</strong> over and over again whenever we want to see the results
            of the code that we wrote can be a hassle. Therefore, we can make our lives easier by installing the 
            <strong>Webpack Dev Server</strong>, which will automate a lot of tasks related to npm scripts. We will
            see that later.
