    <h1>Modern JS Using ES6, NPM, Babel & Webpack</h1>
    <p>
        We use a lot of JavaScript Tools to make a real world project where we apply ES6
        features and also use the concepts of Asynchronous JavaScript. <br>
        Now, in order for us to make a real world JavaScript Project, we will use tools that
        make our lives easier as developers, and some of them are:
        <ol>
            <li>Webpack: to bundle together JavaScript Modules.</li>
            <li>Babel: to convert ES6 Code into ES5.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
