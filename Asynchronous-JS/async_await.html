        // Async/Await
        // -----------
        // We learned about how to Produce and Consume Promises, but the syntax to Consume Promises can still be
        // quite confusing and difficult to manage, and so in ES8/ES2017, something called "Async/Await" was
        // introduced to the JavaScript Langugae in order to make it a lot easier for us developers to Consume
        // Promises. Remember, Async/Await is only designed for the Consuming of Promises, not for the Production.

        // Now, we simply change the way we consume the Promises, therefore, we Produce the Promise in the same way
        // we did using Promises as we saw in promise.html

        // Produce the Promises:

        // would automatically run asynchronously i.e., run in the background, sitting in the Web API environment.

            // any further, until the getIDs Promise is either "Fulfilled" or "Rejected". If the getIDs Promise is

            // Now, if the Promise is Rejected, then an error will be thrown. Now to handle that error, we have to

            // await expressions can only be used inside an async function, and async function always runs in the
            // background, because we can never have the main code (the syncrhonous code) stopping in the middle
            // of the execution. So all we do here is block the code (using await) in the async function, and since
            // it runs in the background, it won't matter if we use await to wait for the Promise to be resolved
            // or rejected, since it is already running in the background.
